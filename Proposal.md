# PhishNet

===========
[https://github.com/aidan-lane/oss-term-project](https://github.com/aidan-lane/oss-term-project)

Overview
--------
The most common security issue amongst companies all across the countries is phishing scams. Constant training is conducted within companies' security teams, however it seemingly makes no difference. Technology professionals are more versed in the world of identifying scams when it comes to phishing, however workers in high speed jobs such as nurses and surgeons, do not have time to analyze every email they receieve. We are proposing a safety net between the user and the link they are clicking. Before a page can redirect after a link is clicked, PhishNet will run the link through a virus scanner and return a safety score. If the score is above a certain threshold, users will be warned before they are allowed to redirect to the page. This takes away the responsibility of the user from having to analyze every link they click while still protecting them from hasty decisions.

Semester Plan
-------------
Obviously, capturing all that is unknown by everyone is a monumental task that will take at least 2 semesters. For this semester we will concentrate on just capturing something that is unknown by seven random strangers we have yet to meet. This will be coded into our project. We will use the process of unknowing capture and encoding to help us build a website that we can use to crowdsource more unknowns. Our semester goal is to have a beta version of the unknown website ready to preliminary testing so that we are on schedule to launch the full website next semester.

Technology
----------
Since this is an unknown project, we are not completely sure what technology stack we will be using. We expect to use the **APL** programming language, or perhaps **x86 assembler** given their high unknowability.

Milestones
----------
Milestones are given as weeks from project start:

- By Week 1 : Investigate the **Unknown** language options and choose one best suited to encapsulate what we don't know.
- By Week 4 : Obtain unknown information on 6 things that 6 random strangers don't know.
- By Week 7 : Have the informaton from the last stranger. We assume that strangers who don't know things will become harder to find once more people know what we are doing.
- By Week 9: Have the seven unknowns coded into the chosen (unknown) language.
- By Week 10 : Completely develop the website that uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to source a cooperative crowd, decide what they don't know and automatically encode it into the chosen language.
